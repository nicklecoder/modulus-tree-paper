Complete Modulus Tree Paper
===========================

This project aims to produce an academic-quality paper documenting complete
modulus trees and some of their basic properties. An outline of the project
is available in `outline.md`. An additional goal of this project is to collect
knowledge of these structures into a single location so that students of
elementary number theory, prime number theory, discrete mathematics, and basic
tree theory can more easily study and explore these structures.

Complete Modulus Trees
----------------------

Complete modulus trees are discrete structures that organize positive integers
into tree structures using the modulus function. They are closely tied to the
Chinese remainder theorem and to Euler's totient function. This makes these
structures particularly suited to many interesting mathematical applications,
including encryption, the study of reduced residue systems and the distribution
of prime numbers, the examination of some of the deeper consequences of the
Chinese remainder theorem, and prime number sieving.

I (Adam Nickle) discovered these structures during a discrete mathematics
course discussion on basic tree theory. Other computer science classes I had
already completed had covered some of the discussion topics, so my mind began
to wander and I began to doodle in a notebook. Eventually, an interesting
question occurred to me: is it possible to create a complete tree based on the
modulus function? After several attempts over the next few days, I produced
what we now refer to as the sequential prime modulus tree. My fellow students
and I found this structure to be so interesting that it kicked off over two
years of original research into their behavior and properties.

This paper is an attempt to codify these learnings into a format that can be
beneficial to anyone interested in learning more about the Chinese remainder
theorem, Euler's totient function (and related functions for counting tuples
in reduced residue systems), primorials, and prime numbers.
